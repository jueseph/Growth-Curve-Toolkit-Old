Growth Curve Toolkit
README

Created 2012/08/17 Jue Wang

This set of .m files contains MATLAB code for processing growth curve data obtained from the Envision plate reader.

This package aims to provide small and modular functions that can be strung together to perform complicated analyses. Functions are provided for basic operations such as loading data, plotting growth curves, and extracting growth rates.
